Description: Improves simultaneous inference under dependence of tests by
    estimating a collapsed null distribution through resampling. Accounting for 
    the dependence between tests increases the power while reducing the
    variability of the false discovery proportion. This dependence is common in
    genomics applications, e.g. when combining flow cytometry measurements with
    microbiome sequence counts.
